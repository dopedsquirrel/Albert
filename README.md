Albert - A Voice Assistant for Accessibility
Albert is a voice assistant project I am building for my father, who is visually impaired. The goal is to help him navigate the digital world more independently while spending meaningful time together during the development process. This project is also my Christmas gift to him.

Initially, Albert is being developed on a Raspberry Pi, focusing on accurate voice-to-text and natural text-to-voice capabilities in German. While the current version aims to respond to simple commands and provide accessibility features, the project is expected to evolve significantly over time as new ideas and requirements emerge.

Current Features
Voice Activation: Albert listens for the phrase "Hallo Albert!" to start interactions.
Voice-to-Text: Converts spoken commands into actionable text.
Natural Text-to-Voice: Delivers responses in a natural-sounding voice.
Future Directions
Expanding language support, potentially including Swiss German.
Adding advanced accessibility features tailored to individual needs.
Experimenting with different hardware and software platforms for scalability.
This project is a personal journey, blending technical exploration and family connection, with the hope of creating something meaningful and practical.
